/*
 * responsive.custom.css is for custom media queries that are not set via the
 * theme settings, such as cascading media queries.
 *
 * By default all the other responsive stylesheets used in Adaptivetheme use a
 * "stacking method", however cascading media queries use a waterfall method so
 * you can leverage the cascade and inheritance for all browsers that support
 * media queries.

 * NOTE: this file loads by default, to disable go to your theme settings and
 * look under the "CSS" settings tab.

   * Float Region Blocks - custom media query CSS example:
   * 
   * Float regions blocks is an Extension you can enable in the appearance
   * settings for your theme. This feature allows you to automatically float
   * blocks in regions, you can switch it on and off depending on your
   * requirements. For design purposes you many want to remove the floats for
   * devices where the entire theme is just one column - for example small
   * mobile phones. The following CSS is inside the custom media query:
   *
   *   @media only screen and (max-width: 480px){}
   *
   * This will target devices with a maximum width of 480px - most small phones.
   * In these smaller screen sizes we can remove the float and widths so all
   * blocks stack instead of displaying horizonally. The selector used is an
   * "attribute selector" which will match on any float block class. Use your
   * inspector or Firebug to get the classes from the page output if you need
   * more granular control over block alignment and stacking.
